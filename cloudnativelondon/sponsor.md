[Cloud Native London](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-London/) is a strong, open, diverse developer community dedicated to the Cloud Native platform and technologies in London. Founded by Cheryl in 2017, it has over 8000 members and monthly events with 100 attendees, including streaming to Youtube and Twitch.

> "At Sysdig, developers are an important audience and we know the way to reach them is through high quality educational content. The Cloud Native London meetup is a great audience, events always run smoothly and need very little input from us. What we really appreciate about Cheryl and Cloud Native London is the consistency of monthly meetups, which allows us to plan ahead and commit to a whole year upfront. It's been a great partnership and we're looking forward to 2023."

## Frequently asked questions

#### Can we host an event at our office?

If your office can host 50-100 and you can commit to hosting on the first Wednesday of every month, email organisers@cloudnativelon.com.

#### Can we run an event on a specific day?

We plan events 6-12 months ahead, so unfortunately we can't add extra events to the schedule.

#### Are we listed as the pizza / beer sponsor?

As pizza and beer are more than any individual contribution, we order catering ourselves and thank all sponsors equally.

#### Can we bring swag and a banner?

You can display a banner inside the room, just bring it on the evening. For the address for shipping swag or requesting a table, email organisers@cloudnativelon.com.

#### Can we sponsor as a recruitment agency?

Yes! We work with one recruitment agency at a time and currently are open to recruitment sponsorship.

#### Can we share our event with your group?
