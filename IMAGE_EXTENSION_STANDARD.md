# Image Extension Standard

## Current Pattern (2024-2026)

Based on review of recent posts, the following pattern is observed:

- **`.jpeg`** - Standard for Cloud Native London meetup photos and most blog post images
- **`.png`** - Used for conference/slide graphics and presentation images
- **`.jpg`** - Used in one instance (2025-05-19-moving-on-from-arm-and-new-adventures.jpg)

## Recommendation

For consistency going forward:
- Use **`.jpeg`** for all photo images (meetups, events, personal photos)
- Use **`.png`** for graphics, slides, and presentation materials
- The existing `.jpg` file is acceptable but future photos should use `.jpeg` for consistency

## Examples

✅ Good:
- `/images/2025-10-01-cloud-native-london-october-2025.jpeg` (meetup photo)
- `/images/2025-11-26-vibe-coding-auth-without-melting-down.png` (conference graphic)

⚠️ Acceptable but inconsistent:
- `/images/2025-05-19-moving-on-from-arm-and-new-adventures.jpg` (should be `.jpeg` but acceptable)
