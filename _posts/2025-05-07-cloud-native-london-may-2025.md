Two speakers from Chronosphere and Cloud Security Podcast joined us at the May Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [DoiT](https://www.doit.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Eric D. Schabell from Chronosphere discussing [Mastering Fluent Bit: Ultimate Guide to Integrating Telemetry Pipelines with OpenTelemetry](https://www.youtube.com/live/nld5GMm6x1U?si=oQBFY5h0c810CKug&t=737)(starting at 12:17). He explained that: 
* Fluent Bit and OpenTelemetry work seamlessly together
* Fluent Bit is an easy to use telemetry pipeline at the edge
* Try a hands-on workshop (https://o11y-workshops.gitlab.io/workshop-fluentbit) for attendees to do exactly at home what they saw on stage!

Following this, Ashish Rajan from the Cloud Security Podcast explained [The Only Top 3 Kubernetes Security Vulnerabilities that matter!](https://www.youtube.com/live/nld5GMm6x1U?si=boDPs-NuYzgBRjKr&t=2808)(starting at 46:48). His takeaways are that:
* Top 3 Cloud based Kubernetes Vulnerabilities
* Adding the Cloud Context to Kubernetes means more exposed ways to be vulnerable to attackers
* Cloud Logs just like Kubernetes Logs are your best friends to be able to respond quickly to security vulnerabilities 

And wrapping up our evening was Haseeb Budhani from Rafay Systems to tell us about [Developer-friendly PaaS for CPU and GPU workloads across Datacenter & Edge Environments](https://www.youtube.com/live/nld5GMm6x1U?si=srXPbih8ehKzhNJz&t=5496)(starting at 1:31:36). He talked about how:
* Developer self-service is now the most important goal for every enterprise.
* 100% focus on public clouds is a thing of the past; hybrid deployments are the future.
* Purchasing and operationalizing GPUs on prem is significantly cheaper than renting GPUs in a public cloud.

And of course, our usual group photo!
