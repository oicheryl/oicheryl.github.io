Three speakers from FusionAuth, CAST AI, and Meghdo joined us at the November Cloud Native London meetup at the eSynergy offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Testkube](https://testkube.io/), [TechShack](https://www.tech-shack.co/), and [CAST AI](https://cast.ai/) for their generous support and sponsorship. More info on them below!

### Overview
Kicking off our evening was Mark Robustell from FusionAuth talking about [Auth: Build vs Open Source vs Buy](https://www.youtube.com/live/DlvwyaacF-M?si=1GsewomBPX9aaeKR&t=973)(starting at 16:13). He talked about:
* Options for Auth	
* Pros and cons of each option	
* How FusionAuth can offer many advantages of each of the options

Following this, Kunal Kushwaha from CAST AI explaining [Container Live Migration: Moving Workloads Without Downtime](https://www.youtube.com/live/DlvwyaacF-M?si=HlyweiS14Vo6WUzC&t=2704)(starting at 45:04). His takeaways are about how to: 
* The automation challenges of migrating workloads at scale.	
* How container live migration is powered and orchestrated in Kubernetes.	
* How to make live migration practical for resiliency and cost optimization.

And wrapping up our evening was Ram Swaminathan from Meghdo exploring [From Manual Ops to Self-Service: Building Cloud Infrastructure Orchestration at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/live/DlvwyaacF-M?si=EfV8KGDD5pmV4zTR&t=5586)(starting at 1:33:06). He discussed:
* Self-Service Platform Engineering: Design principles for building developer-centric infrastructure platforms that eliminate ops bottlenecks while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance through RBAC and audit logging.	
* Sub-60-Minute Multi-Cloud Deployments: Architectural patterns and open-source tool combinations (Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana) that enable instant infrastructure provisioning across AWS, GCP, and Azure without vendor lock-in.	
* Zero Trust Infrastructure Access: How to eliminate long-lived credentials and implement time-bound access tokens for cloud orchestration platforms, reducing security risk while maintaining developer velocity.

And of course, our usual group photo!
