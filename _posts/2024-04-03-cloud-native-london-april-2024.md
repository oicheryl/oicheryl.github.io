Three speakers from EDB, Mia-Platform, and more joined us at the April Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Gabriele Bartolini from EDB with his talk on [Scaling Postgres in Kubernetes Using the Power of CloudNativePG](https://www.youtube.com/live/nlWcT7qqUEs?si=sOcLoLqj-zxHjMbT&t=601)(starting at 10:01). His takeaways mentioned that:

* You can run Postgres databases in Kubernetes.
* Why you need an operator like CloudNativePG.
* Remove yourself from any source of vendor lock-in with this open source stack.

Next up we had Michel Murabito from Mia-Platform telling us about [How to turn Cognitive Load into creativity](https://www.youtube.com/live/nlWcT7qqUEs?si=-sNLGbfPeAlLuKnt&t=2576)(starting at 42:56). Check out his takeaways:

* Challenges are inevitable; the way we respond to challenges is the "moment" when true innovation is born.
* Cognitive load, with evolution, is inevitable.
* Cloud and Platform Engineering are allies in managing cognitive load.

And wrapping up our evening was Rajnish Singh discussing [Data Governance on GCP using Dataplex](https://www.youtube.com/live/nlWcT7qqUEs?si=URCcACd4buGBlzPX&t=5380)(starting at 1:29:40). He talked about: 

* Data Governance and its importance in cloud.
* How to implement data Governance in GCP using cloud native service.
* Enhance data driven business decisions.

And of course, our usual group photo!
