I thoroughly enjoyed this panel with Mich (Mia-platform) and Tolis (AWS), discussing the "Kubernetes moment for AI". Kubernetes was transformative for the cloud computing industry. It brought standardization and interoperability, and creating a whole ecosystem of startup companies and investment. Could we do it again, through open standards, tech and community?

AI platform builders have a choice whether to use closed source or open source as the foundation. Closed source platforms provide many aspects of AI platforms, giving you more time to market to build products.

But open source models have really started to catch up, which gives you the ability to build a in-house platform that can be customised and tailored to your needs, with more choice and control.

To build that platform, you need an open source community and a number of components that are yet to be invented. While this emerging landscape already has some powerful capabilities, there's an opportunity for the community to innovate and create new components that can be used to power that PaaS.
 
As a long time Kubernetes community member, I've been amazed by what the open source community has created. Not only the technology with Kubernetes and the ecosystem of other projects, but also the culture of open source. We have taken what was a potentially limited game to a positive sum game, and now we have the opportunity to do that again in AI.
