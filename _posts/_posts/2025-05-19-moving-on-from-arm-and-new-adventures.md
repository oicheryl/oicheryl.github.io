ðŸ“£ Today I am moving on from Arm. I'm grateful for the rare opportunity to be on the frontier of AI hardware innovation, and wish all the best to a fantastic group of talented and kind people.

ðŸŒ„ So what's next? I'm fortunate to have breathing room for exploration and experimentation. After leaving Google in 2015, I took 9 months to find my way into containers, cloud native, devrel and open source community. I rode that wave for 8 years, and now am excited to discover the next chapter of my career.

ðŸŒ³ Life-wise, I'm planning an epic 3 month adventure to Asia in Summer 2026, before my oldest starts school. It's a cliche that time really flies with young kids, and now is the time to make some life memories.

â˜• I will continue to run my meetup, Cloud Native London, speak at conferences and partner with companies on workshops, so I'm definitely not disappearing. DM me for coffee and Zoom catch ups!
