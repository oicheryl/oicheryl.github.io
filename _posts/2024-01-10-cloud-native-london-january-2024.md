### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Francois Massot from Quickwit with his talk on [Quickwit: Cloud-Native Logging and Distributed Tracing](https://www.youtube.com/live/u_-UZ9ehjYk?si=bsT1uIssGuiNNgBT&t=665)(starting at 11:05). His takeaways mentioned that:

* Observability data is going on object storage because it's cheap.
* You need efficient engine to search through data on object storage.
* Cloud-native engines that queries your observability data on object storage will save you cost and time.

Next up we had Eric D. Schabell from Chronosphere telling us about [3 Pitfalls Everyone Should Avoid with Cloud Native Observability](https://www.youtube.com/live/u_-UZ9ehjYk?si=A5CHvSVBPi1v3DwX&t=2859)(starting at 47:39). He talked about: 

* Many hidden costs to cloud native observability and one often forget about the instrumentation of your existing application landscape.
* Don't get caught up in the 3 pillars, but focus on the 3 PHASES of cloud native observability to get the most out of your time and investments.
* Be nimble, be quick, and above all be sure to not get caught in the cloud native observability tooling sprawl that is pushed on you from all sides!

And wrapping up our evening was Tom Harding from Hasura discussing [Transcending microservices hell for Supergraph Nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/live/u_-UZ9ehjYk?si=8AfpbvJF1DulNOu-&t=5580)(starting at 1:33:00). Check out his offers below:
