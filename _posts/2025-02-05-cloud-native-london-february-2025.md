Three speakers fromAkbank and LiveWyer Ltd joined us at the February Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Metin Sarıkaya from Akbank talking about [From Legacy to Lakehouse: Redefining Data at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/live/m_s33CUGqYw?si=v3NEQACeS9rZfrnt&t=1285)(starting at 21:25). He talked about: 
* Data Complexity is Growing, But So Are the Solutions:
Managing massive, diverse, and fast-moving datasets is a challenge for every enterprise. A well-structured Data Lakehouse combines the strengths of data warehouses and data lakes, making analytics seamless.
* Hybrid & Private Cloud Strategies Are the Future:
While public cloud offers scalability, private cloud ensures security and regulatory compliance. Akbank is pioneering an on-prem Lakehouse approach with Kubernetes, object storage, and open table formats to balance flexibility and control.
* Data Lakehouse is the Key to AI-Driven Decision Making:
Traditional architectures struggle to support real-time analytics and AI-driven workloads. By adopting a Lakehouse approach, enterprises can unlock faster insights, cost-efficient data processing, and scalable AI applications—paving the way for smarter, data-driven decision-making.

And wrapping up our evening was David O'Dwyer from LiveWyer Ltd telling us about [How to Make Things Better: Practical Insights from DevOps to Director](https://www.youtube.com/live/m_s33CUGqYw?si=trk8YcEv0UeILaoH&t=3279)(starting at 54:39).
