Three great speakers from Grafana Labs, Cerbos, and Unum Cloud joined us at the August Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat Takeaway offices and via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Tulayb Mahmood from Grafana Labs, talking about From Zero to Observable. His takeaways discussed:

* Grafana can be used to correlate observability data across multiple tools.
* The Grafana Stack is becoming more opinionated about Kubernetes Monitoring.
* Cost-effective observability needs efficient backends.

Next up we had Alex Olivier from Cerbos telling us about Cloud-Native Chronicles: Lessons Learned from Building Cerbos in the Open. He talked about how: 

* Cloud Native is more than just a label - it implies a certain set of functionality to exist in a project to play nicely in the ecosystem.
* Requirements go beyond shipping a container - implementing support for other projects such as Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry support, a robust Helm chart - the list goes on.
* Feedback from early users is key to understand the need for integrations and ecosystem support - and be open to accepting pull requests!

Finally we had Ash Vardanian from Unum Cloud wrapping up our evening with a discussion on Future of Open-Source AI Infrastructure. His takeaways explored how:

* Four pillars of the modern AI stack: LLMs, Embeddings Models, Vector Search, Databases.
* Given the insane cost of developing and using such tools and models at scale, understanding their relative strengths and weaknesses can easily save millions.
* Data-centers are evolving to include exotic AI chips and immature drivers, making cloud deployments and cross-platform builds harder than ever.

And of course, our usual group photo!
