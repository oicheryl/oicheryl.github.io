### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Mikołaj Karebski from VirtusLab with his talk on [ Overcoming legacy manufacturing challenges with Google Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/live/VLZIzdmtu-8?si=pd8P5xaCPEOcsGkX&t=538)(starting at 8:58). His takeaways mention that:

* The reality of a startup is developing a rough solution first, then refining it later.
* Rushing into solutions can lead to wasted time and money.
* Overcommunication ensures a faster information loop.

Next up we had Subomi Oluwalana from Convoy telling us about [Webhooks & Webhook Gateways](https://www.youtube.com/live/VLZIzdmtu-8?si=fZxQQs73MwkFsm8U&t=2606)(starting at 43:26). He talked about how: 

* Webhooks are great and constitute a great API Design.
* Traditional webhook gateways are often fragile and prone to failure under heavy loads. You’d need to design for resilience and fault tolerance carefully.
* Traditional webhook gateways often fall short in terms of security measures. You’d need to safeguard against vulnerabilities such as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Replay Attacks, and DNS Rebinding attacks.

And wrapping up our evening was Richard Tweed discussing [Using, and mis-using Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Control](https://www.youtube.com/live/VLZIzdmtu-8?si=HHskwixBv0u2mo7x&t=5394)(starting at 1:29:54). His takeaways are about:

* How Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Control can secure clusters.
* How Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Control can take down a cluster.
* How the new Validating Admission Policies will work.

And of course, our usual group photo!
