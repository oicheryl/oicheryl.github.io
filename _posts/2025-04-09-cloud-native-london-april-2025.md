Two speakers from Solo.io and CloudBees joined us at the April Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices. Unfortunately due to some technical issues we werenâ€™t able to have the usual YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Solo.io](https://www.solo.io/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Louis Ryan from Solo.io telling us about How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Service Mesh. He explained that: 
* Understand the 'ambient mesh' architecture and how it changes service mesh operations
* Learn about its ability to scale to huge networks of application and services
* Save yourself some money on your mesh deployment

And wrapping up our evening was Carlos Rodriguez Lopez from CloudBees discussing Jenkins at 20: Scaling CI/CD pipelines in the Cloud-Native Era with EKS Blueprints. His takeaways are about:
* Being Cloud Friendly is a must. Being Cloud Native might be optional for many uses cases.
* Infrastructure and Configuration as Code serve as a universal language for DevOps professionals, enabling faster experimentation with product features and driving their adoption.
* Built demos on the top of a Community frameworks increases reliability and development speed.

And of course, our usual group photo!
