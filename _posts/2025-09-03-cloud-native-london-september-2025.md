### Overview
Kicking off our evening was Martin Reynolds from Harness talking about how to [Revolutionize Your Software Delivery with AI-Powered DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/live/1bUKqnG58eI?si=YCe6l-UGwY3xkr79&t=1013)(starting at 16:53). His takeaways mention: 
* Accelerate Release Velocity: Harness intelligent pipeline orchestration and reusable templates to ship faster.	
* Boost Quality & Resilience: Apply AI-driven testing and proactive reliability controls.
Integrate Security by Design: Leverage DevSecOps and automated governance for speed and compliance.
* Reserve your spot now and don’t miss the opportunity to learn from the front lines of AI-powered DevOps transformation.

Following this, Martin Stadler from Mirantis discussed how to [Manage Kubernetes at Scale: Platforms, Infrastructures, and k0rdent](https://www.youtube.com/live/1bUKqnG58eI?si=3mV7c0A57XhgSXRK&t=2834)(starting at 47:14). He explained that: 
* k0rdent architecture follows a declarative approach to cluster management using Kubernetes principles. The modular extensible architecture provides a repeatable template-driven solution to interact with subcomponents such as the Cluster API (CAPI) and other Kubernetes components.
* k0rdent has been tested with AWS EC2, AWS EKS, Azure Compute, Azure AKS, vSphere, and OpenStack (so far!), and can be easily extended to support other publicly-available and custom providers. It provides a modular, Helm-based templating system that makes it easy to standardize and automate infrastructure and services provisioning—whether for traditional cloud applications or the next wave of AI-driven workloads.
* k0rdent eliminates CAPI’s complexity, ensures component compatibility, enhances add-on management with Sveltos, and provides built-in observability—all in a production-ready, streamlined platform.

And wrapping up our evening was Sohan Maheshwar from AuthZed telling us about [How Google built a Consistent, Global Authorization System with Zanzibar (and you can too!)](https://www.youtube.com/live/1bUKqnG58eI?si=cvVdeiwPhKDJ1iIg&t=5339)(starting at 1:28:59). He described:
* What is ReBAC aka Relationship Based Access Control	
* What the Google Zanzibar Model, Language and API looks like	
* The Architecture & Implementation details - How Zanzibar performs at scale while maintaining correctness and consistency. 

And of course, our usual group photo!
