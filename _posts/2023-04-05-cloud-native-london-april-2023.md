Three fantastic speakers from Mia-Platform, CBRE, and Vodafone joined us at our April Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat Takeaway offices, and virtual attendees via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

In addition, we have an exclusive offer for our members:
[**WTF is SRE?**](https://www.cloud-native-sre.wtf/) is a highly-rated, very-tweeted-about, ridiculously-fun, wildly-insightful two-day conference designed to improve the world of Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps. It will take place in [CodeNode, London](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=51.518934,-0.085426&z=16&t=m&hl=en&gl=GR&mapclient=embed&q=10+South+Pl+London+EC2M+7EB+UK) on **4-5 May 2023**.

Last year, we had three world-class tracks: Observability, Reliability and DevSecOps. In our third and in-person edition of the conference, we're adding another! Get ready for next-level insights into the world of DevEx (Developer Experience).

_WTF is SRE?_ is by the Community and for the Community, that's why we are very happy to provide all the Cloud Native London members with a generous 25% off. Make sure to use [this link](https://ti.to/container-solutions/wtf-is-sre-2023/with/3al7wujcoky) for your exclusive discount!

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Giulio Roggero from Mia-Platform talking about What it means to be a Platform Engineer (and some concepts about Platform Engineering) (starting at [14:06](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAF1OC5SpnY?feature=share&t=846)). His takeaways explained how:

* Platform Engineering is not a new topic but it's the normal evolution of eXtreme Programming, Agile and DevOps: focus on value generated. Platform Engineers' aim is to create the best DevX and simplify the life of Devs.
* Adopt Platform Engineering approaches is an incremental journey: start simple and improve.
* Tools are essential but are not enough, also focus on adopting good practices from Agile, DevOps and Team Topologies.

Next up we had Saeid Bostandoust from CBRE with a discussion on Kubernetes, Prometheus and Monitoring in Multi-tenant environments (starting at [41:35](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAF1OC5SpnY?feature=share&t=2495)). He talked about: 

* Multi-tenant Kubernetes monitoring challenges.
* Challenges of Multi-tenant monitoring using Prometheus.
* Introduction to Prometheus Multi-tenant Proxy Server.

Finally we had Richard Kilmurray from Vodafone wrapping up our evening with a talk on Infusing Telco Networks with Cloud Native Technologies (starting at [1:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAF1OC5SpnY?feature=share&t=5077)). His takeaways discussed how:

* Telco brings demanding workloads that will draw upon the full spectrum of cloud-native software and standards will be important.
* CI/CD makes its way into telco networks.
* Observability techniques must be blended with existing telco monitoring

And of course, our usual group photo!
