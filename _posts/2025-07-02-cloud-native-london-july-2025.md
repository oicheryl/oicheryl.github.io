Two speakers from Dash0 and Cloudbees joined us at the July Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Cloudbees](https://www.cloudbees.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Kasper Borg Nissen from Dash0 discussing [Breaking Free with Open Standards: OpenTelemetry and Perses for Observability](https://www.youtube.com/live/xtOj5Tz0xqE?si=bLKKFAKSrPyLNVS6&t=1037)(starting at 17:17). He explained that: 
* OpenTelemetry is standardizing telemetry collection. Perses is standardizing dashboarding.	
* Applying Platform Engineering principles transforms observability into a seamless, scalable, and developer-friendly experience.	
* Building on Open Standards allows you to freely move between vendors, ensuring they stay on their toes and provide you the best possible experience.

And wrapping up our evening was Stu Brown from Cloudbees helping us [Learn How to Unify Your DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/live/xtOj5Tz0xqE?si=q7p-sTsIW3Td0Tdu&t=3275)(starting at 54:35). He talked about:
* No More Tradeoffs: Gain centralized visibility and governance without compromising developer experience or requiring tool migrations.
* AI-Enabled Control Plane: Leverage intelligent automation and insights across your entire SDLCâ€”powered by embedded agentic AI.
* Scalable Governance: Achieve enterprise-grade compliance and control without slowing down innovation or velocity

And of course, our usual group photo!
