Three speakers from Flagsmith, BrassicaPay, and more joined us at the January Cloud Native London meetup at Civo Tech Junction, as well as via the YouTube/LinkedIn livestreams. Unfortunately there were some audio issues with the livestream for the first two talks.

We are immensely grateful to [Flagsmith](https://www.flagsmith.com/) and [TechShack](https://www.tech-shack.co/) for their generous support and sponsorship. 

### Overview
Kicking off our evening was Kyle Johnson from Flagsmith talking about [Feature Flags: A Safety Net in the AI Era](https://www.youtube.com/live/H2ltTiONqow?si=3Od4-NXooKvI0ToS&t=724)(starting at 12:04). He discussed how to:
* Without explicit safety measures, increased reliance on AI-generated code leads to a loss of control over codebases and production behaviour.
* Feature flagging is a great safety net: it allows both AI-generated and traditional code to be deployed to production with no behavioural change, enabling controlled rollouts to internal users or small customer cohorts before wider release.
* AI—despite its imperfections—will fundamentally reshape how software is built and redefine what is possible.

Following this, we had Shubhangi Goyal explaining [Context driven AI Agents](https://www.youtube.com/live/H2ltTiONqow?si=--F0vWIeg3tgqMgS&t=2013)(starting at 33:33). Her takeaways were about: 
* Context engineering, manage memory tools, and tasks for adaptive behaviour	
* Prompt engineering into the larger system	
* Understanding the use of context engineering

And wrapping up our evening was Mawuko Jeffrey Wilson from BrassicaPay exploring [Why Cloud Cost Assessment Must Come Before Cloud-Native Build](https://www.youtube.com/live/H2ltTiONqow?si=61Lp0562JJl-9MGy&t=5484)(starting at 1:31:24). He stated that:
* Cost surprises are architectural, not accidental: Most cloud overspend originates from early service choices, pricing models, and design assumptions-not from poor monitoring alone.
* Cost alerts are controls, not only strategy: Budgets, alerts, and subscriptions help manage spend-but they cannot replace upfront cost modelling and architectural cost awareness.
* Cost assessment must sit alongside security and architecture: Sustainable cloud-native systems treat cost as a first-class design constraint, just like resilience and security. And multi-cloud doesn’t remove cost risk-it multiplies it. Without consistent cost assessment practices, organisations face fragmented spend and reduced financial visibility across AWS, Azure, and GCP (others).

And of course, our usual group photo!
