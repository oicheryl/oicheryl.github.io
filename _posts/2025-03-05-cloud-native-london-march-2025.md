Four speakers from MicroStrate, Nutanix, and Just Eat Takeaway joined us at the March Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Robert Jeffery from MicroStrate discussing [A better ‘Cloud-Native’ experience, all thanks to streams](https://youtu.be/BMUpO4ykQYM?si=E0n6qj2kI49GMuRF&t=593)(starting at 9:53). He explained that: 
* Time is money and with most cloud services there’s too much time wasted setting up and managing those services, MicroStrate makes it super simple and fast to deploy and manage your cloud-native application
* MicroStrate's stream based logging and monitoring tools make it easy to diagnose errors with complex distributed systems 
* Performance limitations with common cloud services (think cold starts, size constraints, slow auto-scaling) can really impact your users, and tie up your engineering team with trying to work around those constraints.  MicroStrate’s proprietary streaming based technology offers low latency and high capacity. 

Following that was Jake Tame from Nutanix with his talk on [Fleet What?](https://youtu.be/BMUpO4ykQYM?si=aB_NVf_kveTEqJ6z&t=1962)(starting at 32:42). His takeaways stated that:
* Unified Management: Nutanix offers robust solutions to manage Kubernetes clusters seamlessly across Nutanix, VMware, Bare Metal, EKS, and AKS and IaaS.
* CAPI Efficiency: Cluster API deployments simplify and standardize the rollout of Kubernetes clusters, reducing operational complexity.
* Integrated Ecosystem: Nutanix’s supported products and hybrid cloud approach ensure efficient fleet management across diverse environments.

And wrapping up our evening was Stephen Perera and Ozgur Sinan Uyar from Just Eat Takeaway asking us [What does it cost?](https://youtu.be/BMUpO4ykQYM?si=_tp7bsohF6-ZVE0k&t=4575)(starting at 1:16:15). Their takeaways are about:
* Utilising BigQuery editions capabilities effectively for managing the cost after migration. Project federation for enhanced observability, experimentation and fast actions.
* Raising awareness and accountability for computations costs. Keeping things fun and interactive and effective with improved monitoring tools and in house optimisation checker.
* How to manage a company wide migration and cultural shift into a new way of utilising the computation engine.

And of course, our usual group photo!

## Cloud Native London April

Our next meetup will be on Wednesday 9th April (one week later than usual to avoid clashing with Kubecon), when we'll be joined by speakers from Solo.io and CloudBees! [RSVP and save the date now!](https://www.meetup.com/cloud-native-london/events/305905095/). 

Stay safe, stay healthy, and see you in a month!
