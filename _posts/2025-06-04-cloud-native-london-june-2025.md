Two speakers from Flagsmith and Doubleword joined us at the June Cloud Native London meetup at the Esynergy Technology offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Flagsmith](https://www.flagsmith.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Adrian Gregpry and Matt Elwell from Flagsmith discussing [Building a Healthy Platform Engineering Stack with Open-Source Feature Flags](https://www.youtube.com/live/S-SdTQ9HTYo?si=gaejNQwoZA-hPrLt&t=591)(starting at 9:51). He explained that: 
* Open-source feature flags and observability can work together to give flexibility and visibility into the SDLC and let teams improve builds and monitor results
* Open standards in feature flagging are massively on the rise thanks to OpenFeature (akin to OpenTelemetry)
* Feature flags are deep in your code base, so limiting vendor lock-in is extra important

And wrapping up our evening was Peter Bhabra from Doubleword to tell us about [The Missing Manual: Transforming AI Research into Resilient Distributed Systems](https://www.youtube.com/live/S-SdTQ9HTYo?si=cFOgGWdP5Gv77kIp&t=2637)(starting at 43:57). Unfortunately we had a technical issue with recording his audio. He talked about how:
* Successful AI deployment isn't about having the best model.
* Distributed systems infrastructure is more important than model optimisation at enterprise scale.
* Self hosting will 200x in the next 3 years and inference will become an enterprise priority.

And of course, our usual group photo!
