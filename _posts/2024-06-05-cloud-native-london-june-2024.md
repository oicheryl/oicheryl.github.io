It was also Kubernetes 10th birthday, as well as being Pride Month, so we had cake in celebration!

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Steve Wade with his talk [From free-kicks to git commits](https://www.youtube.com/live/OhtxLJpp338?si=HjM32SwFV2MQV0ad&t=658)(starting at 10:58). His takeaways mentioned that:

* How the soft skills honed on the football field can be invaluable in the tech industry.
* The resources, communities, and strategies that facilitated my transition and how you can leverage these in your career pivot.
* Key lessons from my journey include the importance of continuous learning, embracing failure, and the power of community support.

Next up we had Stephen Perera from JustEat discussing [Platform & DevOps practices](https://www.youtube.com/live/OhtxLJpp338?si=rCDOW7DGhLWYUv1f&t=2575)(starting at 42:55). He talked about: 

* Building platforms isn't new. Using DevOps to build platforms helps teams to build and manage them effectively. DevOps is a set of capabilities, technical, process and cultural. It isn't a team type or a job title. The model is based on data from teams working in industry using technologies like cloud computing.
* From the technical practices - version control, trunk based development, continuous Integration, deployment automation and automated testing can be used to ensure small changes are pushed into a system with high frequency increasing agility and stability. 
* Thinking about how you use the technical practices can lead to dramatic increases in efficiency and impact for your users. 

And wrapping up our evening was Alex Tasioulis from Cloudified telling us about [Cost Conscious Cloud Native Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/live/OhtxLJpp338?si=dG0lxUVkKcCkT-3-&t=5229)(starting at 1:27:09). Check out his takeaways:

* Cost Efficiency Equals Cloud Nativeness: cost efficiency is one of the main benefits of the cloud but people often forget!
* A Cloud Native SDLC should empower engineers to be able to develop the required work without spending a fortune.
* Engineers must understand the cost implications of their architectural and tactical decisions; too many companies have been affected by surprise bills due to lack of awareness.

And of course, group photo time!
