Three speakers from stack8s, Cockroach Labs, and Polysemantic joined us at the December Cloud Native London meetup at Palo Alto Networks, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [Testkube](https://testkube.io/), [TechShack](https://www.tech-shack.co/), and [stack8s](https://stack8s.org/) for their generous support and sponsorship. 

### Overview
Kicking off our evening was Dr Jeremy Murray from stack8s talking about [Decoupling from the Hyperscalers: A Kubernetes-Based Sovereign AI & Compute Platform](https://www.youtube.com/live/kSQ17YDTvuI?si=k2TYO82AquKDoe6T&t=669)(starting at 11:09). He discussed how to:
* Learn how Kubernetes can serve as the foundation for a fully sovereign compute and AI platform - giving organizations complete control over their infrastructure, data locality, and compliance	
* Discover design patterns and open source tooling that enable true hybrid and multi-cloud operations - avoiding vendor lock-in while maintaining scalability, security, and performance	
* Discover design patterns and open source tooling that enable true hybrid and multi-cloud operations - avoiding vendor lock-in while maintaining scalability, security, and performance

Following this, we had Rob Reid from Cockroach Labs explaining [From Chaos to Confidence: How I Learned to Love - And Laugh in the Face Of - Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/live/kSQ17YDTvuI?si=v-x532hdWRv0ne_0&t=3007)(starting at 50:07). His takeaways were that: 
* Databases are just software and they shouldn’t be babied
* True resilience isn’t about avoiding failure, it’s about embracing it until it’s boring
* Legacy systems don’t protect modern workloads

And wrapping up our evening was Radu Sora from Polysemantic exploring [Checking Out of Hotel California: The Case for Spark on Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/live/kSQ17YDTvuI?si=kYlhmdHTwLSoUG4S&t=5589)(starting at 1:33:09). He stated that:
* You're paying a premium for a solved problem: At scale, Databricks charges a "7-figure" premium for infrastructure orchestration, a problem the CNCF ecosystem has already solved. You can achieve massive cost savings (often over 50%) by switching to an open-source stack	
* The "It's Too Hard" myth is dead: The fear of managing Kubernetes is outdated. A modern, open-source stack (EKS + Spark Operator + Karpenter + Argo Workflows) provides a manageable, declarative, and often more flexible platform than you get from a vendor, without the black-box complexity	
* The biggest win isn't cost, it's culture: Moving off a "magic" platform forces engineers to re-engage with performance, efficiency, and cost. This "escape" from vendor lock-in fosters a stronger, more inquisitive engineering culture that understands its tools and owns its stack.

And of course, our usual group photo!

## Cloud Native London January

Our next meetup will be on Wednesday 7th January, when we'll be joined by speakers from Flagsmith, Testkube, and Nirmata! [RSVP and save the date now!](https://www.meetup.com/cloud-native-london/events/310408549/). 

Stay safe, stay healthy, and see you in a month!
