Two speakers from BT Group and Searce joined us at the December Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

We are immensely grateful to [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/) for their generous support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Xuan Du from BT Group talking about the [Telco Cloud Evolution Towards Cloud Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJGdVntV9ZA). He talked about how: 
* With several industry trends in telecoms, how to adopt cloud and cloud-native technologies has been one of the most important aspects for the evolution of telco network infrastructure, where the radio access network (RAN) is a good example and probably also the most sophisticated part of telco infrastructure.
* Driven by very diverse tenants and dynamic applications running on the telco cloud infrastructure, leveraging the right blend of cloud-native technology choices and heterogeneous hardware such as multi-arch CPUs and GPUs has been important to build and operate a highly flexible, scalable and automated compute continuum from a telco operatorâ€™s perspective.
* The adoption of cloud-native technologies and involvement in open-source communities by telco operators allows them to play a more significant role in the telecoms industry and accelerate the technology innovation and adoption in the ecosystem.

And wrapping up our evening was Katsiaryna Stankevich from Searce telling us about [Geospatial analysis in Big Query](https://www.youtube.com/live/dJGdVntV9ZA?si=wYw5Wi7EE1rf6Quh&t=2012)(starting at 33:32). Her takeaways were:
* BigQuery's geospatial capabilities allow for complex spatial queries, including proximity analysis, geofencing, and point-in-polygon calculations, all within a serverless architecture optimized for scalability and performance.
* BigQuery Geo Viz offers an intuitive interface to visualize geospatial data directly from BigQuery, enabling easy testing and interpretation of geospatial queries without requiring additional visualization tools.
* BigQuery seamlessly handles large-scale geospatial datasets with native support for geospatial data types, reducing the need for pre-processing and enabling streamlined workflows for geospatial data integration and analysis. 

And of course, our usual group photo!
