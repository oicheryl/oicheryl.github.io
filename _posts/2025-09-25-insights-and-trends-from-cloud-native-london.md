I'm thrilled to be in Edinburgh speaking at Scotsoft, and sharing my insights on cloud, open source and AI.

In 2017 I started a meetup, Cloud Native London, with no speakers, no venue and no attendees. Just 7 weeks later, over 100 people turned up to the first event. Now Cloud Native London has grown to 10,000 members, and is one of the strongest and most vibrant developer communities in Europe.

In this talk, I will delve into software architecture insights and trends over the last 8 years. Iâ€™ll look at both technical and strategic developments, and transformational opportunities for individuals and organisations going forwards.

Takeaways:
* Consumable > configurable
* Manage your open source exposure
* Embrace AI but stay alert
