Two speakers from Amazon Web Service and more joined us at the November Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices.
### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Roman Shmyhelskyi talking about the Rocky Road to Microservices. He talked about how: 
* Transitioning to microservices is a natural evolution for many growing projects, and it is important to approach it thoughtfully to achieve the desired benefits.
* Successful implementation of microservices requires cross-team communication and alignment, ensuring that independent services work together seamlessly and meet shared objectives.
* Transitioning to microservices is most effective when done incrementally, allowing teams to learn and adapt while minimising the impact of changes on the overall system.

And wrapping up our evening was Liliia Rafikova from Amazon Web Service telling us about Mastering DynamoDB: Scalable, NoSQL Databases for Modern Applications. Her takeaways were to:
* Design for Access Patterns with a Schema-Less, Single-Table Approach: DynamoDBâ€™s schema-less structure and single-table design philosophy enable flexible, efficient data modeling. Instead of modeling tables by entity type, focus on access patterns to create efficient, scalable designs that minimize data duplication and retrieval costs.
* Use Primary Keys and Indexes Strategically: Primary keys, particularly composite keys, and secondary indexes (GSIs and LSIs) are essential for efficient querying and performance in DynamoDB. Choosing the right primary key and index structure enables you to optimize queries, avoid hot partitions, and improve read/write efficiency based on application needs.
* Balance Consistency, Cost, and Performance: DynamoDB offers features like eventual vs. strong consistency, and options to partition, sort, and project data selectively. Understanding these options helps balance consistency requirements, control costs, and deliver high performance, making DynamoDB a powerful tool for modern applications that need to scale.

And of course, our usual group photo!
