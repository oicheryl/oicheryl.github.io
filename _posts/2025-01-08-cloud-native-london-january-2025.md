Three speakers from TitanML and Mia-Platform joined us at the January Cloud Native London meetup at the Just Eat offices, as well as via the YouTube/Twitch livestreams. 

### Overview

Kicking off our evening was Meryem Arik from TitanML discussing [Navigating LLM Deployment: Tips, Tricks, and Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/live/0_kPIQAxT18?si=8plM6o4Wx0Nc7v5t&t=524)(starting at 8:44). She talked about: 
* You may need to self-host language models if you are concerned about control, cost, or customizability.
* Your deployments will look different to the deployments of big AI Labs like OpenAI.
* Use the fact that you have knowledge about your workloads to your advantage when you're building your inference stack. 

And wrapping up our evening was Graziano Casto and Rhea Arora from Mia-Platform telling us about [Platform Engineering untold truths: is it just an infrastructure matter?](https://www.youtube.com/live/0_kPIQAxT18?si=x-XDbaCHEzYh-igo&t=3944)(starting at 1:05:44). Their takeaways stated that:
* Platform Adoption Goes Beyond Infrastructure: Adopting a platform impacts the entire organization, not just the infrastructure domain. It integrates key organizational assets, like data, to drive success.
* Enabling a Circular Economy of Resources: A modern platform should act as a reusable resource catalog, fostering a circular economy where items are created, consumed, and evolved for continuous value generation.
* Collaboration Fuels Value Creation: The platform accelerates value creation by enabling teams to share and evolve catalog items. This collaboration ensures that innovations and adaptations benefit the entire organization.

And of course, our usual group photo!
